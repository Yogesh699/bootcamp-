# 02.2 Weekday Lesson Plan: CSS Resets, Pseudo-Classes, and Pseudo-Elements

## Overview

The theme of today's class is overwriting browser defaults. Students will implement a CSS reset to zero-out certain styles and then rebuild those styles using advanced CSS concepts like pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements.

## Instructor Notes

* In this lesson, students will complete activities `11-Ins_CSS-Resets` through `20-Stu_Custom-Forms`.

* Today's lesson also touches on typography. Students will likely see different fonts on their machines depending on their operating system, so be prepared to discuss web-safe fonts and font fallbacks.


## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to do the following:

* Why you would use a CSS reset.

* Use typographical CSS properties, like `font-family` and `line-height`.

* Add pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements to HTML elements.

* Default styles that browsers apply to form elements.


## Class Instruction

### 1.

* A big part of CSS is undoing, or restyling, the default styles that the browser gives you. This is especially true for form elements, which are ubiquitous across the web but not as easy to customize as `<div>` and `<span>` containers.

* Open the [Postcard Form Example](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/html/forms/postcard-example/) in your browser:

  * The MDN Web Docs team built this form as an example of what's possible with CSS.

  * The `<textarea>`, `<input>`, and `<button>` elements have all been customized.


* We will look at additional CSS properties that will help us rebuild our own forms.

### 2. CSS Resets

* Open `11-Ins_CSS-Resets/index.html` in your browser:

  * ðŸ”‘ This page has no style sheet, but the browser already renders elements a certain way.

  * ðŸ”‘ Every browser renders these defaults differently, which can cause unwanted discrepancies.

  * Developers find it helpful to reset these defaults before applying their own styles, allowing them to write CSS with peace of mind.

* Open `11-Ins_CSS-Resets/index.html` in your IDE:

  * ðŸ”‘ Let's add a style sheet that resets these defaults by uncommenting the `<link>` element:

    ```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/css/reset.css" />
    ```

  * ðŸ”‘ In the browser, all of the margins, padding, and font sizes have been normalized. Now a developer can rebuild these styles from scratch exactly the way they want.

* Open `11-Ins_CSS-Resets/assets/css/reset.css` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * ðŸ”‘ We use a wildcard selector to reset the box size of every element:

    ```css
    * {
      margin: 0;
      padding: 0;
      box-sizing: border-box;
    }
    ```

  * ðŸ”‘ We give the `<html>` element a `height` of `100%` and the `<body>` a `min-height` of `100%` to ensure the document always takes up at least the size of the viewport. This makes it easier to position things like footers:

    ```css
    html {
      height: 100%;
    }

    body {
      min-height: 100%;
      line-height: 1;
      font-family: sans-serif;
    }
    ```

  * ðŸ”‘ Several HTML elements like `<input>` and `<button>` have their own font styling, so we reset them to match the rest of the page:

    ```css
    input, select, option, optgroup, textarea, button,
    pre, code {
      font-size: 100%;
      font-family: inherit;
    }
    ```
    font-size: 100%; : This line sets the font size of the selected elements to 100% of their parent element's font size. Essentially, it means the font size should be the same as the default font size for the page or the nearest ancestor element that has a font size defined. 

    font-family: inherit; : This line sets the font family of the selected elements to inherit from their parent element. In other words, it makes these elements inherit the same font family as their parent element. This ensures that these elements use the same font as the rest of the page.


### 3. Student Do: CSS Resets (15 min)

*  `12-Stu_CSS-Resets`.


### 4. Instructor Review: CSS Resets


* Open `12-Stu_CSS-Resets/Solved/index.html` in your IDE:

  * We needed to swap the `<link>` elements so that the `reset.css` style sheet loads first:

    ```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/css/reset.css" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/css/style.css" />
    ```

  * ðŸ”‘ When style sheets have conflicting CSS rules, like a generic `h1` selector, the style sheet that's loaded second will take precedence.

* Open `12-Stu_CSS-Resets/Solved/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE:


### 5. Instructor Demo: Typography

* Typography in CSS refers to the styling and design of text on a web page

* Open `13-Ins_Typography/index.html` in your browser. Inspect the `<p class="one">` element with Chrome DevTools:

  * ðŸ”‘ The class has a `font-family` value of `'Helvetica', 'Arial', sans-serif`.

  * ðŸ”‘ Multiple fonts are listed in case the user's operating system can't find the first or second one. Helvetica, for instance, is usually not installed on Windows machines.

  * ðŸ”‘ The `font-weight` and `font-style` properties can make a font appear bold or slanted, but by how much depends on the font being used. For instance, `oblique` will often look the same as `italic`.

* Inspect the `<p class="four">` element with Chrome DevTools:

  * ðŸ”‘ Setting the `text-transform` property to `uppercase` or `capitalize` will change how the text is capitalized:

    ```css
    .four {
      font-family: serif;
      font-weight: 100;
      font-style: normal;
      text-transform: uppercase;
      text-decoration: none;
    }
    ```

  * ðŸ”‘ Setting the `text-decoration` property to `underline` or `line-through` will apply a line to the text:

    ```css
    .four {
      font-family: serif;
      font-weight: 100;
      font-style: normal;
      text-transform: uppercase;
      text-decoration: underline;
    }
    ```

  * ðŸ”‘ There are many ways to alter a font with CSS, but making a font look good usually comes down to adjusting the `margin`, `line-height`, and `font-size`.


### 6. Student Do: Typography

*  `14-Stu_Typography`.


### 7. Instructor Review: Typography


* Open `14-Stu_Typography/Solved/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE :

  * We adjusted the `body` CSS rule to include a base `line-height` and `font-size`:

    ```css
    body {
      display: flex;
      flex-direction: column;
      line-height: 1.5;
      font-size: 16px;
    }
    ```

  * ðŸ”‘ We added margins to the headers, set the `font-size` to be a percentage of the base font, and set the `font-family` to the operating system's default `serif` font:

    ```css
    h1 {
      margin: 2%;
      font-size: 200%;
      font-family: serif;
    }

    h2 {
      margin: 3% 0;
      font-size: 180%;
      font-family: serif;
    }

    h3 {
      font-size: 150%;
      font-family: serif;
    }
    ```

  * We adjusted the paragraph element's top and bottom margins:

  ```css
  article p {
    margin: 2% 0;
  }
  ```

  * We adjusted the list element's left margin, set the `list-style` to be `square`, and changed the `font-family` to the default `monospace` font:

    ```css
    article ul {
      margin-left: 5%;
      list-style: square;
      font-family: monospace;
    }
    ```


### 8. Instructor Demo: Pseudo-Classes (5 min)

* Open `15-Ins_Pseudo-Classes/index.html` in your browser:

  * ðŸ”‘ With CSS, we can style the different states that an element can be in.

  * When you move the cursor over a button, it's in a **hover** state.

  * When you actively press the cursor down on a button, it's in an **active** state.

  * ðŸ”‘ When you've clicked on or tabbed into a button, it's in a **focus** state.

* Open `15-Ins_Pseudo-Classes/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE:

  * ðŸ”‘ In CSS, we use pseudo-classes like `:hover` to capture these different states:

    ```css
    button:hover {
      background-color: #772014;
      color: #fff;
    }
    ```

  * In the `:focus` pseudo-class, we set the `outline` property to `none` to remove the browser's default highlight border:

    ```css
    button:focus {
      outline: none;
      border-color: #8ac4ff;
    }
    ```


### 9. Student Do: Pseudo-Classes 

* `16-Stu_Pseudo-Classes`
  

### 11. Instructor Review: Pseudo-Classes

* Open `16-Stu_Pseudo-Classes/Solved/index.html` in your IDE:

  * We added `<h3>` and `<ul>` elements inside of the resources `<div>`:

    ```html
    <div class="resources">
      <h3>
        Show Resources
      </h3>
      <ul class="links">
        <li>
          <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Responsive_Design">MDN Web Docs on responsive design</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries">MDN Web Docs on using media queries</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox">MDN Web Docs on flexbox</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    ```

* Open `16-Stu_Pseudo-Classes/Solved/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * ðŸ”‘ We initially set the `<ul>` element to `display: none` to remove it from the document flow:

    ```css
    .resources .links {
      display: none;
      padding: 1% 0;
    }
    ```

  * ðŸ”‘ When the parent `.resources` element is in a hover state, we change the `display` of the child `.links` element to `block`. This returns it to the document flow, but only while the parent is in its hover state:

    ```css
    .resources:hover .links {
      display: block;
    }
    ```

### 12. Instructor Demo: Pseudo-Elements (5 min)

* Open `17-Ins_Psuedo-Elements/index.html` in your browser. Inspect the `<h1>` element with Chrome DevTools:

  * The only text in the `<h1>` element is "CSS".

  * ðŸ”‘ An `::after` pseudo-element has been added with CSS to insert extra content after the original content:

    ```css
    h1::after {
      font-family: Impact;
      content: 'Pseudo Elements';
      color: #8ac4ff;
      margin-left: 5px;
    }
    ```

* Inspect one of the `<h3>` elements with the Chrome DevTools to demonstrate the following:

  * ðŸ”‘ A `::before` pseudo-element has been added with CSS to insert extra content before the original content:

    ```css
    h3::before {
      font-family: Impact;
      content: '\273A';
      color: #772014;
      margin-right: 5px;
    }
    ```

* Inspect the `<span>` element with Chrome DevTools:

  * ðŸ”‘ A `::after` pseudo-element has been combined with a `:hover` pseudo-class to create a tooltip when hovering over the `<span>`
    
    ```css
    #css-tooltip:hover::after {
      content: "A message which appears when a cursor is positioned over an icon, image, hyperlink, or other element in a graphical user interface";
      position: absolute;
      left: 0px;
      bottom: 24px;
      min-width: 200px;
      border: 1px #aaaaaa solid;
      background-color: #772014;
      padding: 12px;
      color: #fff;
      font-size: 80%;
      z-index: 1;
    } 
    ```


### 13. Student Do: Pseudo-Elements

*  `18-Stu_Pseudo-Elements`


### 14. Instructor Review: Pseudo-Elements


* Open `18-Stu_Pseudo-Elements/Solved/index.html` in your IDE:

  * You could've used any term or phrase to apply the tooltip. In this example, I will use the phrase, "Cascading Style Sheets".

  * ðŸ”‘ We added an `id` selector to each `<span>` element to easily reference it in css:

    ```html
    <span id="css-span">Cascading Style Sheets</span>
    ```

* Open `18-Stu_Pseudo-Elements/Solved/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE:

  * ðŸ”‘ We selected the `<span>` element that has an `id="css-span"` attribute and set the `position` to `relative`. This will help us position the tooltip relative to the `<span>`:

    ```css
    #css-span {
      position: relative;
      text-decoration: underline;
      color: #000;
      cursor: grab;
    }
    ```

  * ðŸ”‘ We combined the `::after` pseudo-element with the `:hover` state to insert the tooltip. The content is set to any desired text. The tooltip is positioned absolutely, but relative to its parent:

    ```css
    #css-span:hover::after {
      content: "Commonly known as CSS";
      position: absolute;
      left: 0px;
      bottom: 24px;
      min-width: 200px;
      border: 1px #aaaaaa solid;
      background-color: #13293d;
      padding: 12px;
      color: #fff;
      font-size: 80%;
      z-index: 1;
    }
    ```

### 15. Instructor Demo: Custom Forms

* Open `19-Ins_Form-Styles/index.html` in your browser.

  * ðŸ”‘ HTML form elements have many default styles applied by the browser.

  * The `<input>` elements have a CSS declaration of `cursor: text`.


### 16. Student Do: Custom Forms

* `20-Stu_Custom-Forms`.


### 17. Instructor Review: Custom Forms


* Open `20-Stu_Custom-Forms/Solved/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE:

  * ðŸ”‘ We set the `<select>` element's `appearance` to `none` and inserted a background image to replace the arrow that originally came with `appearance`.

    ```css
    select {
      appearance: none;
      background-image: url("../images/arrow.png");
      background-repeat: no-repeat;
      background-position: right;
      background-size: contain;
    }
    ```

  * We styled the focus and empty states of the `<input>` elements. An empty state can be captured with the `:placeholder-shown` pseudo-class:

    ```css
    .text-input:focus {
      border-right-width: 5px;
    }

    .text-input:placeholder-shown {
      border-style: dashed;
    }
    ```

  * ðŸ”‘ We used a sibling selector to alter the styles of an element that is next to another element. In this case, the `<label>` element is a sibling of the checkbox. The styles change when the checkbox is in a checked state:

    ```css
    .checkbox:checked + label {
      color: #999999;
      font-style: italic;
    }

    .checkbox:checked + label::after {
      margin-left: 10px;
      font-size: 90%;
      content: "(thanks!)";
    }
    ```
