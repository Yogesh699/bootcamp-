# 02.3 Weekday Lesson Plan: CSS Selectors and Variables

## Overview 

This lesson is all about exposing students to what's possible with CSS for both the end user and the developer who's writing it. Whereas the previous two lessons primarily focused on essential CSS knowledge, this lesson introduces some other tools and skills that will increase the students' efficacy in building webpages.

## Instructor Notes

* In this lesson, students will complete activities `21-Ins_Wireframing` through `28-Stu_Mini-Project`.

* This day is about exposing students to other tools and features available in CSS. They've learned a lot of foundational knowledge that's required in the field, but CSS can also be a lot of fun once they get the hang of it.

* To emphasize that CSS can be fun and interesting, class will begin with a quick introduction to wireframing.


## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to do the following:

* Create and explain the purpose of a wireframe.

* Use CSS selectors to reference HTML elements in different ways.

* Use CSS variables to keep their code clean.

* Use advanced CSS styling for an enhanced UI.


## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do:


* Open [Wireframe example from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website_wireframe#/media/File:Profilewireframe.png) in your browser and explain the following:

  * The image you are looking at is called a **wireframe** and it is a tool developers use to create robust UI/UXs.

  * Wireframes allow us to visualize how our webpages will act and feel before we do any actual coding.

  * Wireframes can be hand-sketched or you can use digital tools like Figma or Framebox.

 *  There are three main elements to an effective wireframe: information design, navigation design, and interface design.
    
    * Information design: How we place and present information to our users.

    * Navigation design: How the user moves throughout the site and how pages relate to each other.

    * Interface design: How the user interacts with the elements on the page, with a focus on functionality.

  * students will get hands-on experience by creating a wireframe for this module's mini-project.

### 2. Instructor Demo: Wireframing

* Open `21-Ins_Wireframing/assets/Images/01-unfinished-wireframe.png` in your IDE:

  * This image shows the start of a wireframe for the module's mini-project, with the rows and columns highlighted.

  * 🔑 When creating a wireframe, we want a way to visually represent our page layout. Using rows and columns is an effective way to guide our decision-making when placing elements on the page.

  * 🔑 These rows and columns directly translate to containers that we can use when we begin coding the mini-project.

* Open `28-Stu_Mini-Project/Main/index.html` in your browser:

  * Here is the final product that we will create today, which you can keep in mind as you work on your wireframe.


### 3. Student Do: Wireframing

* `22-Stu_Wireframing/README.md`.


### 4. Instructor Review: Wireframing


* Open `22-Stu_Wireframing/Solved/assets/Images/01-wireframe-form-completed.png`  


### 5. Instructor Demo: CSS Selectors

* Open `23-Ins_CSS-Selectors` in your browser :

  * 🔑 We can be very specific in how we select certain HTML elements using CSS.

  * 🔑 There's no difference to the user in how we achieved this result.

* Open `23-Ins_CSS-Selectors/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE:

  * 🔑 We can use the `:nth-child()` selector to apply styles to elements based on their order.

  * 🔑 We can use the adjacent sibling `+` selector to apply styles to elements that come after another specific element.

  * 🔑 We can use the direct child `>` selector to apply styles to elements that are direct children of an HTML element.


* visit the [MDN Web Docs on CSS selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors) for more information.


### 6. Student Do: CSS Selectors (15 min) 

* `24-Stu_CSS-Selectors/README.md`.


### 7. Instructor Review: CSS Selectors (10 min)  


* Open `24-Stu_CSS-Selectors/Solved/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE: 

  * 🔑 We select specific `<a>` elements based on their `href` attribute value with square bracket notation `[]`:

    ```css
    a[href$='.css']::after {
      content: '📝';
      display: inline-block;
      margin-left: 3px;
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 We use `$=` syntax to match any `href` value that ends with `.css`.

  * We use the `::after` pseudo-element to add an icon to the right of the selected `<a>` element.


### 8. Instructor Demo: CSS Variables

* Open `25-Ins_CSS-Variables` in your browser:

    * create custom CSS variables (also called custom properties) and apply them to the root of the page, making them accessible to all other CSS 
  
   ```css
    :root {
      /* declare a variable with `--` syntax */
      --dark: #13293d;
      --light: #fff;
      --navlink-color: #b9c6ae;
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 There's no difference on the page&mdash;everything looks the same!

  * 🔑 Not every enhancement to your site will be noticeable by your users.

* Open `25-Ins_CSS-Variables/assets/css/style.css` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 We can create CSS variables to hold repeated values and reference them instead.
  

### 9. Student Do: CSS Variables

* `26-Stu_CSS-Variables/README.md` 

### 10. BREAK (10 min)

### 11. Instructor Review: CSS Variables (10 min)  

* Open `26-Stu_CSS-Variables/Solved/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE: 

  * We identify where values are repeated throughout the style sheet.

  * 🔑 Repeating values throughout a style sheet can introduce a lot of errors, so we store them under a named variable:

    ```css
    :root {
      --white: #fff;
      --dark-blue: #13293d;
      --border-radius: 50px;
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 By selecting the root HTML element `:root`, we can make these custom CSS properties (variables) available throughout our style sheet.

  * 🔑 This is great for colors because hex codes are hard to remember, but you can also use it with other values like border radius.


### 12. Everyone Do: Git Pull and Merge Conflicts (10 min)

  * Whenever we want to retrieve updated code from the repository in GitHub, we use `git pull` to integrate it into the local codebase.

  * Sometimes, however, the changes we have made and tracked with Git locally and the changed code we're pulling from GitHub don't match up. Because of this, Git doesn't know how to resolve the issue, and it creates what's known as a **merge conflict**.

* This activity will serve as a guide to help understand merge conflicts and how to fix them. 

* Open `27-Evr-Git-Pull-Conflict`.


### 13. Instructor Demo: Mini-Project (5 min) 

* Open `28-Stu_Mini-Project/Main` in your browser:

  * 🔑 The page adjusts its layout on different screen sizes.

  * 🔑 When we hover over a CSS snippet card, it glows.

  * 🔑 When we click on a CSS snippet, the entire block of code is highlighted.

### 14. Student Do: Mini-Project (45 min)

* `28-Stu_Mini-Project/README.md`.

### 15. Instructor Review: Mini-Project

* Open `28-Stu_Mini-Project/Main` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * 🔑 The HTML `<pre>` element interprets spaces and returns literally, so the HTML code needs to look a little disjointed.

  * 🔑 We build a mobile-first style sheet, where the media queries apply to larger screens, not smaller:

    ```css
    /* media query for larger screens */
    @media screen and (min-width: 992px) {
      header {
        width: 75%;
      }

      .card-column {
        flex: 0 0 33.333%;
        max-width: 33.333%;
      }
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 We can create a gradient effect for the backgrounds using the `linear-gradient()` function:

    ```css
    .code-card pre {
      /* set styles to make it so code wraps in <pre> instead of overflowing */
      white-space: pre-wrap;
      overflow: auto;
      tab-size: 4;
      padding: 1.2rem 1rem;
      color: var(--gin);
      border-radius: 8px;
      /* use linear-gradient() function to create a fading background  */
      background-image: linear-gradient(
        rgba(232, 102, 236, 0.3) 0%,
        rgba(232, 102, 236, 0.6) 100%
      );
      display: flex;
      align-items: center;
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 We can animate HTML elements on a pseudo-class state using the `transition` property:

    ```css
    .code-card {
      display: flex;
      flex-direction: column;
      justify-content: flex-start;
      min-height: 100%;
      padding: 2rem;
      color: var(--heliotrope);

      /* outline is like border, but on the outside of the box instead of inside */
      outline: 2px dashed var(--gin);
      outline-offset: -2px;
      transition: all 0.5s ease-in-out;
    }
    ```

  * We create the glowing effect with an inner and outer box shadow:

    ```css
    .code-card:hover,
    .code-card:hover .card-header {
      box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 8px var(--heliotrope), 0 0 15px var(--heliotrope);
    }
    ```

  * We can change the selection color by updating the `::selection` pseudo-element.


### 16. Instructor Demo: Introduce Challenge

* Open `02-Challenge/Main/index.html` in your browser:

  * A portfolio is a great way for developers to put themselves out there and demonstrate their skills while having fun. 

  * Your portfolio doesn't need to be fancy, but it should be informative about who you are, what you've done, and how to contact you.


* Open `02-Challenge/README.md`.
