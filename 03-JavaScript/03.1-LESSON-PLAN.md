## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do:
 

* Open `28-Stu_Mini-Project/Main/index.html` in your browser:


### 2. Instructor Demo: Script and Console.log

* Open `01-Ins_Script-ConsoleLog\index.html` in your IDE: 

  * 🔑 In this HTML file, HTML and CSS are working together to provide style and structure to the page, as you can see in the following code:

    ```html
    <h1 style="text-align:center;">Open the Console to See the Magic ✨! </h1>
    ```
    
  * 🔑 There is also something new: `<script>` tags for JavaScript.

  * 🔑 We use inline `<script>` tags to write scripts directly in an HTML file, as shown in the following example:

    ```html
    <script>
    console.log("This is the log for the 🔥INLINE🔥 JavaScript");
    </script> 
    ```

  * 🔑 We add an `src` attribute to the opening `<script>` tag to link to an external JavaScript file, as follows:

    ```html
    <script src="script.js"></script>
    ```

  * 🔑 We write `<script>` tags above the closing `</body>` tag to ensure that the HTML and CSS load first, as follows:
  
    ```html
    <body>
      <h1 style="text-align:center;">Open the Console to See the Magic ✨! </h1>
      <script>
      console.log("This is the log for the 🔥INLINE🔥 JavaScript");
      </script>
      <script src="script.js"></script>
    </body>    
    ```

  * We use the `console.log()` method to log, or display, messages or data to the console. We place the message inside a string between the parentheses of the function call, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    console.log("This is the log for the 🔥INLINE🔥 JavaScript");
    ```

* Open `01-Ins_Script-ConsoleLog\script.js` in your IDE and note the following: 

  * JavaScript looks and performs the same whether it is written inline or in an external file. For example, the following snippet will log the message "This is the log for the 🔥EXTERNAL🔥JavaScript":

      ```js
      console.log("This is the log for the 🔥EXTERNAL🔥JavaScript");
      ```

* Open `01-Ins_Script-ConsoleLog\index.html` in the browser and navigate to the console in Chrome DevTools. 


### 3. Student Do: Script and Console.log

* `02-Stu_Script-ConsoleLog\README.md`.


### 4. Instructor Review: Script and Console.log


* Open`02-Stu_Script-ConsoleLog\Solved\index.html` in your IDE:
  

### 5. Instructor Demo: Hello Variable

* Open `O3-Ins_Hello-Variable/script.js` in your IDE:

  * 🔑 We use the `var` keyword to declare a variable. After the `var`, the variable is given a unique name, or identifier, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    var studentName;
    ```

  * 🔑 Declaring a variable only gives it a name. To assign a value, we use the assignment operator `=` preceding the value we want the variable to hold, as shown in the following example: 

    ```js
    var studentName = "Abdul";
    var studentAge = 32;
    ```

  * 🔑 We also use the `=` assignment operator to reassign a new value to a variable. To reassign a value, we use the variable's name followed by `=` and the new value we want the variable to hold. Because the variable has already been declared, there is no need to use `var` again, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    studentName = "Tonya";
    studentAge = 52;
    ``` 

  * 🔑 Using the variable name is also useful in code when we want to access the value held in the variable and do something with it, like log it to the console. 

  * 🔑 In the previous activity, we put a value directly inside the `()` in a console log function to log a message. When the value was entered directly, that value appeared as the message in the console, as shown in the following code:

    ```js
    console.log("My name is ");
    ```

  * 🔑 When we want to access a value stored in a variable, we don't directly enter the value. Instead, we use the variable name&mdash;without quotes&mdash;to access the value stored in the variable. Because the value of `studentName` is currently `Tonya`, the following console log will log `Tonya`:

    ```js
    console.log(studentName);
    ```
 
  * 🔑 Sometimes we want to use a variable as part of a longer message logged to the console. To do that, we use the concatenation operator (`+`). In the following example, `"My name is "` is concatenated, or combined, with the value stored in the variable `studentName`, forming the longer message `"My name is Tonya"`:

    ```js
    console.log("My name is " + studentName);
    ```
  
* Open `O3-Ins_Hello-Variable/index.html` in your browser and navigate to the console:

  * When we combine the value `"My name is "` and the value stored in the `studentName` variable with a `+`, it logs a single message: `"My name is Tonya"`. Using the concatenation operator to combine variable values into more complex messages will be useful in creating the introductions in the next activity. 
  

### 6. Student Do: Hello Variable

* `04-Stu_Hello-Variable/README.md`.


### 7. Instructor Review: Hello Variable


* Open `04-Stu_Hello-Variable/Solved/script.js` in your IDE: 

  * 🔑 We declare variables using `var` and assign a value using `=`. The variable `personName` is declared using `var` and assigned the value `"Sakura"`, as follows:

    ```js
    var personName = "Sakura";
    ```

  * 🔑 The variable's values are accessed using the variables' names. Because we have assigned the variables the values `"Sakura"`, `3` , and `"I like pineapple on my pizza."`, those values are used in the following console logs: 

    ```js
    console.log("My name is " + personName + ".");
    console.log("I have " + pets + " pet(s).");
    console.log("Fun fact: " + funFact);
    ```

  * 🔑 We reassign a variable's values using `=`. As shown in the following example, the `var` keyword is not used during reassignment because the variable has already been declared:

    ```js
    personName = "Mateo";
    pets = 5;
    funFact = "I was a yo-yo champ in third grade."
    ```

  * After the variables are reassigned, the variable names will access the new values `"Mateo"`, `5`, and `"I was a yo-yo champ in third grade."`. The console logs will use the new values, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    console.log("My name is " + personName + ".");
    console.log("I have " + pets + " pet(s).");
    console.log("Fun fact: " + funFact);
    ```


### 8. Instructor Demo: Primitive Types

* In the previous activity, we learned to store values in variables. In this activity, we will dive deeper into the types of values that are stored in variables&mdash;namely, the primitive types (undefined, string, number, and Boolean).

* Open `05-Ins_Primitive-Types/script.js` in your IDE: 

  * 🔑 A variable that has been declared using `var` but has not yet been assigned a value has the type of **undefined**. Undefined, as shown in the following snippet, simply means that no value has been assigned yet:

    ```js
    var myUndefined;
    ```

  * 🔑 **Strings** should already look familiar because we have already been using them in code. Values with the type of string are series of characters. They are commonly words but can also include other characters. Strings are always surrounded by quotes, like in the following example:

    ```js
    var myStringWelcome = "Hello World"; 
    var myStringPassword = "865Password!2020";
    ```

  * 🔑 **Numbers** should look familiar too! In JavaScript, a number can be either an integer (a whole number) or a decimal, as follows:

    ```js
    var myNumberInt = 100;
    var myNumberDecimal = 100.100;
    ```

  * 🔑 **Booleans** are unique because they hold only one of two values (`true` or `false`), as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    var isMyBooleanTrue = true;
    var isMyBooleanFalse = false;
    ```

  * 🔑 Sometimes we want to check what type of value is stored in a variable. To evaluate type, use the `typeof` operator preceding the variable name or value, as follows:

    ```js
    console.log(typeof myUndefined);

    console.log(typeof myNumber); 

    console.log(typeof true);

    console.log(typeof "Howdy");
    ```

  * 🔑 When a variable is reassigned, its type can change too. For example, `myVariable` originally has the value of `33`, making it a number. Then, when we use `=` to reassign it, as shown in the following example, it has the value of `false`, making it a Boolean:

    ```js
    var myVariable = 33;
    console.log(typeof myVariable);

    myVariable = false;
    console.log(typeof myVariable); 
    ```

### 9. Student Do: Primitive Types 

* `06-Stu_Primitive-Types/README.md`.


### 10. BREAK (15 min)


### 11. Instructor Review: Primitive Types

* Open `06-Stu_Primitive-Types/Solved/script.js` in your IDE:

  * 🔑 The variable `one` has the whole number value of `64`, making it a number, as follows:

    ```js
    var one = 64;
    ```

  * 🔑 Using the `typeof` operator, as follows, `number` is logged:

    ```js
    console.log(typeof one);
    ```

  * 🔑 The variable `two` has the value of `"656302"`. Because the value is surrounded by quotes, it is a string&mdash;even if the characters inside the strings are numbers! See the following example:

    ```js
    var two = "656302";
    ```

  * When we use the `typeof` operator, `string` is logged, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    console.log(typeof two);
    ```

  * 🔑 `true` and `false` values are Booleans, so the variable `three` with a value of `false` is a Boolean in the following example:

    ```js
    var three = false;
    ```

  * When we use the `typeof` operator, as follows, `boolean` is logged:

    ```js
    console.log(typeof three);
    ```

  * The variable `four` has a decimal value of `64.55`. Because both integers and decimals are considered numbers in JavaScript, the variable in the following example is a number:

    ```js
    var four = 64.55;
    ```

  * When we use the `typeof` operator, as follows, `number` is logged:

    ```js
    console.log(typeof four);
    ```

  * In the following code, the variable `five` has a value of `"Howdy"`, which is a string:

    ```js
    var five = "Howdy!";
    ```

  * When we use the `typeof` operator, as follows, `string` is logged:

    ```js
    console.log(typeof five);
    ```

  * 🔑 The variable `six` is declared but has not yet been assigned a value. So the type returns `undefined` in the following example:

    ```js
    var six;
    ```

  * When we use the `typeof` operator in the following example, `undefined` is logged:

    ```js
    console.log(typeof six);
    ```

  * 🔑 Reassigning a value, as follows, can change both value and type:

    ```js
    four = "Hello!";
    five = false;
    six = 23;
    ```

  * The variable `four` is now a string. So when we use `typeof` in the following example, `string` is logged:

    ```js
    console.log(typeof four);
    ```

  * Variable `five` is now a Boolean. So when we use `typeof`, as follows, `boolean` is logged:

    ```js
    console.log(typeof five);
    ```

  * 🔑 Because variable `six` now has been assigned a value using the `=` assignment operator, it is no longer undefined. Instead, when we use `typeof`, as follows, `number` is logged:

    ```js
    console.log(typeof six);
    ```


### 12. Instructor Demo: Logical and Comparison Operators

* Open `07-Ins_Logical-Comparison-Operators/script.js` in your IDE:

  * 🔑 We can use arithmetic operators to create simple math equations. We set the variable `a` to have a value of `100` and variable `b` to `10` . Both of these are numbers. When we run `a + b`, as follows, it will evaluate to `110`:

    ```js
    var a = 100;
    var b = 10;

    console.log(a + b);
    ```

  * 🔑 Arithmetic operators include addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), division (`\`), and multiplication (`*`), as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    console.log(a + b);
    console.log(a - b);
    console.log(a / b);
    console.log(a * b);
      ```

  * 🔑 The modulus `%` arithmetic operator returns the **remainder**, or what is left over after dividing one number by another. When we divide `100` by `10`, the remainder is `0` because `10` divides into `100` evenly. So `a % b` returns `0`, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    var a = 100;
    var b = 10;

    console.log(a % b);
    ```

  * In addition to performing math equations, we can also use comparison operators to determine the equality or difference of values. 

  * 🔑 We can determine whether two values are equal using the equality operator (`==`). The values of `b` and `c` are both `10`. So `b == c`, in the following example, returns `true`:

    ```js
    var b = 10;
    var c = "10";

    console.log(b == c);
    ```

  * 🔑 We can also test for inequality using the inequality operator (`!=`). Because the values of `b` and `c` are both `10`, `b != c` returns `false` in the following example: 

    ```js
    console.log(b != c);
    ```

  * 🔑 When we use `==`, it only tests for equality of value. To test **strict equality**, we use `===`. The values of `b` and `c` are both `10`, but one is a string and the other is a number. Because they are not equal in both value and type, `b === c` returns `false` in the following example:

    ```js
    console.log(b === c);
    ```

  * 🔑 We can also test for inequality of value or type using `!==`. The variables `b` and `c` do not have the same type (one is a string, and the other is a number). So if either value or type is inequal, `b !== c` returns `true` in the following example:

    ```js
    console.log(b !== c);
    ```

  * 🔑 To evaluate greater than or less than, we use the greater than (`>`) or less than (`<`) operators. If `a` is greater than `b`, the first expression returns `true`. If `a` is less than `b`, the second expression returns `true` in the following example:

    ```js
    console.log(a > b);
    console.log(a < b);
    ```

  * 🔑 To evaluate greater than or equal to and less than or equal to, we use `>=` or `<=`. In this case, if `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the first expression returns `true`. If `a` is less than or equal to `b`, the second expression returns `true` in the following example:

    ```js
    console.log(a <= b);
    console.log(a >= b);
    ```

  * It is also possible to determine logic between expressions using logical operators **and** (`&&`), **or** (`||`), and **not** (`!`).

  * 🔑 We use the logical operator `&&` to check whether both expressions evaluate to `true`. If both expressions evaluate to `true`, then `true` is returned. Otherwise, `false` is returned. See the following code snippet for an example:

    ```js
    console.log(expression1 && expression2);
    ``` 

  * 🔑 We use the logical operator `||` to check whether one expression OR the other evaluates to `true`. If one expression evaluates to `true`, then `true` is returned. Otherwise, `false` is returned. See the following code snippet for an example:

    ```js
    console.log(expression1 || expression2);
    ```

  * 🔑 The logical operator `!` adds `not` to an expression, negating it. If the expression evaluates to `true`, then we can add `!` to it, making it `not true`, or `false` (or vice-versa), as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    console.log(expression2);

    console.log(!expression2);
    ```
  
* Open `07-Ins_Logical-Comparison-Operators/index.html` in your browser and open the console:


### 13. Student Do: Logical and Comparison Operators

* `08-Stu_Logical-Comparison-Operators/README.md`.


### 14. Instructor Review: Logical and Comparison Operators


* Open `08-Stu-Logical-Comparison-Operators/Solved/script.js` in your IDE: 

  * Variables `d` and `e` use arithmetic operators to perform simple math. Because `c` has a value of `100` and `b` has a value of `50`, when we calcuate the remainder of `100` divided by `50` it is `0`. So the value of `d` is `0`. Likewise, the value of `e` is `100` divided by `2` or `50`. Both variables `d` and `e` have the type of `number` in the following example:

    ```js
    var b = 50;
    var c = 100;
    var d = c % b;
    var e = c / 2;
    ```

  * Both `b` and `e` have the value of `50`, making them both numbers. So `expression1` evaluates to `true` in the following example:

    ```js
    var expression1 = (b === e);
    ```

  * The variable `e` has a value of `50` and variable `d` has a value of `0`. Because `50` is not less than `0`, `expression2` evaluates to `false` in the following example:

    ```js
    var expression2 = (e < d);
    ```

  * Because `a` holds the value `50`, as a string, and `b` holds the value `50`, as a number, `===` returns `false`&mdash;because while the values are equal, the type is not. However, in the following example, when we use `==`, it returns `true` because `==` evaluates only value (not type!):

    ```js
    console.log(a == b);
    ```

  * The variables `b` and `e` both hold the value `50`, making them both numbers. Because they are equal in value and type, when we use `===` in the following example, it returns `true`:

    ```js
    console.log(b === e);
    ```

  * Because `c` is greater than `b`, when we use the comparison operator `>` in the following example, it returns true:

    ```js
    console.log(c > b);
    ```

  * Because `d` evaluates to `0`, it is less than `1`. So when we use the comparison operator `<`, as follows, it returns `true`:

    ```js
    console.log(d < 1);
    ```

  * Because the `||` operator requires only one expression or the other to evaluate to `true`, when we use `||` in the following example, it returns `true`:

    ```js
    console.log(expression1 || expression2);
    ```
  
  * Alternately, it is possible to negate `expression2` so that it returns `true`. Because both expressions now evaluate to `true` when we use the `!` operator, the following example returns `true`:

    ```js
    console.log(expression1 && !expression2);
    ```

  * When we remove `!` negation from the first expression, it returns `true`. Because one of the expressions now evaluates to `true`, the following example returns `true`: 

    ```js
    console.log( expression1 || expression2);
    ```


### 15. Instructor Demo: Conditional Statements

* Open `09-Ins_Conditional-Statements\script.js` in your IDE:

  * 🔑 Earlier we talked about how JavaScript can add decision-making to your code. That decision-making can be achieved using conditional statements. 

  * Let's start by declaring variables with `var` and assigning them values with the assignment operator `=`, as shown in the following example:

      ```js
      var hungerLevel = 50;
      var isLunchTime = true;
      var lunchBill = 11;
      ```

  * 🔑 For the first `if` statement, we will also need an expression to evaluate. Using the value stored in the variable `hungerLevel` and the conditional operator `>=`, we can create the expression `hungerLevel >= 50`. This expression, shown in the following snippet, will return `true` because the value of `hungerLevel` is currently `50`:

    ```js
    hungerLevel >= 50
    ```

  * 🔑 Now we are ready to write the `if` statement. We start by writing `if` in lowercase letters. (This part is important; using `IF` can result in an error!) Then in parentheses `()`, we put the expression that we want evaluated. We are evaluating `hungerLevel >= 50` in the following example:

    ```js
    if (hungerLevel >= 50)
    ```

  * 🔑 Next, we want something to happen if the condition is met, or `hungerLevel >=50` evaluates to `true`. To do this, we add curly brackets `{}`, and inside the curly brackets, we add the desired action. In the following example, if the expression `hungerLevel >=50` evaluates to `true`, then we want the message `"Hungry`" logged to the console:

    ```js
    if (hungerLevel >= 50) {
    console.log("Hungry!");
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 The action will only be executed if the expression evaluates to `true`. Because `hungerLevel >= 50` evaluates to `true`, the message `"Hungry!"` will log to the console. However, if we change the expression to one that evaluates to `false`&mdash;like `hungerLevel < 50`, as follows&mdash;then nothing will log:

    ```js
    if (hungerLevel < 50) {
    console.log("Hungry!");
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 If we want one action to be performed if an expression evaluates to `true` and another action to be performed if the expression evaluates to `false`, then we can use an `else` statement. If `isLunchTime === true` evaluates to `true`, then `"Lunchtime"` will log. Else, `"Not Lunchtime"` will log, as follows:

    ```js
    if (isLunchTime === true) {
    console.log("Lunchtime");
    } else {
    console.log("Not Lunchtime");
    }
    ```

  * Or, instead of writing `isLunchTime === true`, we can simply write `isLunchTime`. Because `isLunchTime` has the value of `true`, in the following example, `"Lunchtime!!"` will log to the console:

      ```js
      if (isLunchTime) {
      console.log("Lunchtime!!");
      } else {
      console.log("Not Lunchtime!!");
      }
      ```

  * 🔑 The `!` logical operator can also negate the expression. Because `!Lunchtime` evaluates to `false` when we add`!`, in the following example `"It's Lunchtime Already !!` is logged:

    ```js
    if (!isLunchTime) {
    console.log("Not Lunchtime Already!!");
    } else {
    console.log("It's Lunchtime Already !!");
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 We can also use `else if` to test more than one condition. If the first condition evaluates to `true`, then the first action is executed. Otherwise, the second condition is tested, and so on. This process continues until a condition evaluates to `true` and the associated action is executed, as follows:

    ```js 
    if (lunchBill < 10) {
    console.log("Cost Rating: $");
    } else if (lunchBill >= 10 && lunchBill < 15) {
    console.log("Cost Rating: $$");
    ```

  * If none of the conditions evaluate to `true`, then the action after `else` is executed, as follows:

    ```js 
    } else {
    console.log("Cost Rating: $$$");
    }
    ```


### 16. Student Do: Conditional Statements

* `10-Stu_Conditional-Statements/README.md`.


### 17. Instructor Review: Conditional Statements


* Open `10-Stu_Conditional-Statements/Solved/script.js` in your IDE: 

  * We can evaluate whether both expressions are `true` using the logical `&&` operator, as follows:

    ```js
    expression1 && expression2
    ```
  
  * 🔑 To create the conditional statement, we start with `if` and place `expression1 && expression2` in parentheses `()`. The action we want to be performed if the condition evaluates to `true` is written inside curly brackets `{}`. In this case we want to log `True ✅ True ✅` to the console, as follows:

    ```js
    if(expression1 && expression2) {
    console.log("True ✅ True ✅");
    ```

  * 🔑 If `expression1 && expression2` evaluates to `true`, then `True ✅ True ✅` is logged and no other conditions are evaluated. If not, then the second condition is tested.

  * 🔑 The second condition tests whether `expression1` is true. So we place `expression1` in the parentheses, as follows: 

    ```js
    } else if (expression1) {
    ```

  * If `expression1` evaluates to `true`, then `True ✅ False ❌` is logged and no other conditions are evaluated. If `expression1` does not evaluate to `true`, the next condition is tested, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    } else if (expression1) {
      console.log("True ✅ False ❌");
    ```

  * The process repeats again for the remaining `else if` condition. If `expression2` evaluates to `true`, then `False ❌ True ✅` is logged, as follows:

    ```js
    } else if (expression2) {
      console.log("False ❌ True ✅");
    ```

  * 🔑 At this point, all the conditions have been tested. If none of the conditions evaluate to `true` after all have been tested, then the action following `else` will execute. In this case, `False ❌ False ❌` will log to the console, as follows: 

    ```js
    } else {
      console.log("False ❌ False ❌");
    ```

  * 🔑 The action performed depends on the values inputted for the variables `x`, `expression1`, and `expression2`. Because `x` has a value of `50`, both `expression1` and`expression2` currently evaluate to `false`. So because none of the conditions are `true`, in the following example, the expected action is that `False ❌ False ❌` is logged: 

    ```js
    var x = 50;
    var expression1 = (x < 25);
    var expression2 = (x > 50);
    ```

* Open `10-Stu_Conditional-Statements/Solved/index.html` in your browser: 

  * Because both `expression1` and `expression2` evaluate to `false`, `False ❌ False ❌` logs to the console. However, if the inputs change, the action performed might change.


### 18. Supplemental material
* 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on expressions and operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.
