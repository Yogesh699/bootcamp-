# 03.3 Weekday Lesson Plan: Objects

## Overview

In today's class, students will learn about objects, object methods, and the keyword `this`. Local Git branching, `checkout`, and merging will be introduced as well. This lesson also includes a group mini-project aimed at reinforcing and building on foundational JavaScript skills.

## Instructor Notes

* In this lesson, students will complete activities `21-Ins_Objects` through `28-Stu_Mini-Project`.

* The last hour of class will be devoted to the Rock, Paper, Scissors mini-project. In addition to applying the fundamentals covered in class, students will research the `window` methods `alert()`, `confirm()`, and `prompt()` on their own and find a way to randomize the computer's selection. Encourage students to use pseudocoding as a problem-solving tool if they feel overwhelmed. They can also refer to the documentation provided in `28-Stu_Mini-Project\README.md`.



## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

  * Define and use JavaScript objects.

  * Use JavaScript object methods.

  * Explain and use the `this` keyword.


## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: 

* Demo the mini project

### 2. Instructor Demo: Objects

* Open `21-Ins_Objects/script.js` in your IDE:

  * ðŸ”‘ JavaScript **objects** are a lot like objects in real life. They are things that have distinct characteristics or properties. For this first JavaScript object, the thing we will create is a planet.

  * ðŸ”‘ We use object literal notation to create the `planet` object, and we use curly brackets `{}` to hold the values, as follows:

    ```js
    var planet = {};
    ```

  * ðŸ”‘ We use key-value pairs to give the properties a name and a value, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    name: "Earth"
    ```

  * ðŸ”‘ Objects usually have many related properties that help to define the object, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    var planet = {
      name: "Earth",
      age: "4.543 billion years",
      moons: 1,
      isPopulated: true,
      population: "7.594 billion"
    };
    ```

  * ðŸ”‘ To access the value stored in a property, we use dot notation, as follows:

    ```js
    console.log(planet.name);
    ```

  * ðŸ”‘ We can also use bracket notation to access a value. When we use bracket notation, the key goes in quotes, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    console.log(planet["name"]);
    ```


### 3. Student Do: Objects

* `22-Stu_Objects/README.md`.


### 4. Instructor Review: Objects


* Open `22-Objects/Solved/script.js` in your IDE:

  * ðŸ”‘ We declare a `customerDrink` object using object literal notation. We give the object three properties, as follows:

    ```js
    var customerDrink = {
      name: "coffee",
      sugars: 3,
      isReady: true
    };
    ```

  * ðŸ”‘ We use key-value pairs to define each property, like in the following example:

    ```js
    name: "coffee"
    ```

  * To access the whole object, we use the object's name, as follows:

    ```js
    console.log(customerDrink);
    ```

  * ðŸ”‘ We use dot notation to access a value stored in a key-value pair, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    if (customerDrink.isReady) {
      console.log("Ready for pick-up: " + customerDrink.name + " with " + customerDrink.sugars + " sugars.");
    }
    ```

  * ðŸ”‘ We can also use bracket notation to access a value, as follows:

    ```js
    else {
      console.log("Still in order queue: " + customerDrink["name"] + " with " + customerDrink["sugars"] + " sugars.");
    }
    ```


### 5. Instructor Demo: Object Methods

* Open `23-Ins_Object-Methods/script.js` in your IDE:

  * ðŸ”‘ An object's properties can also hold lists of values or even functions, as shown in the following code:

    ```js
    var planet = {
      name: "Earth",
      age: "4.543 billion years",
      moons: 1,
      isPopulated: true,
      population: "7.594 billion",
      neighboringPlanets: ["Mars", "Venus"],
      tellFunFact: function () {
        console.log("The earth is the only planet in our solar system not named after a Roman god or goddess.");
      },
      showWarning: function () {
        console.log("Space junk falls into Earth's atmosphere at a rate of about one a day.");
      }
    };
    ```

  * ðŸ”‘ We use arrays to store lists of values in key-value pairs, as follows:

    ```js
    neighboringPlanets: ["Mars", "Venus"]
    ```

  * ðŸ”‘ To access an element in an array contained in an object, we can use the object's name and key, plus the index of the element&mdash;as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    console.log(planet.neighboringPlanets[0]);
    console.log(planet["neighboringPlanets"][0]);
    ```

  * ðŸ”‘ To declare a method, we assign a key. A **method** is simply a function associated with an object. See the following code for an example:

    ```js
    tellFunFact: function () {
      console.log("The earth is the only planet in our solar system not named after a Roman god or goddess.");
    },
    showWarning: function () {
      console.log("Space junk falls into Earth's atmosphere at a rate of about one a day.");
    }
    ```

  * ðŸ”‘ To call or invoke an object's method, we use the object's name followed by the assigned key. Don't forget the `()`, shown in the following example:

    ```js
    planet.tellFunFact();
    planet.showWarning();
    ```


### 6. Student Do: Object Methods

*  `24-Stu_Objects-Methods/README.md`.


### 7. Instructor Review: Object Methods


* Open `24-Stu_Object-Methods/Solved/script.js` in your IDE:

  * The `chosenPet` variable holds the name of the chosen pet, as follows:

    ```js
    var chosenPet = "Lulu";
    ```

  * Our first function, `dogMessage`, attempts to reference `Lulu` by using dot notation on the variable `chosenPet`. However, `chosenPet` is a reference itself to the string `Lulu` and not an object. Changing the reference to just `chosenPet` resolves this issue. So, the function should now look like:

    ```js
    function dogMessage() {
      console.log("Congrats! " + chosenPet + ", a great dog, is available for adoption!");
      apptMessage();
    }
    ```

  * Finally, we have a `console.log` in our conditional statement. It attempts to reference the featured pet in the `cats` or `dogs` array if the `chosenPet` is not found. Both of these references to the featured pets are incorrect. The reference to the featured dog should be changed to `shelter.dogs[0]` and the cat to `shelter.cats[0]`. The final log statement should look like the following:

    ```js
    console.log("Check out our featured dog, " + shelter.dogs[0] + ". or our featured cat, " + shelter.cats[0]);
    ```


### 8. Instructor Demo: this

* Open `25-Ins_Object-This/index.html` in your browser and navigate to the console:

  * ðŸ”‘ When we log the keyword `this`, the `window` object is logged.

  * ðŸ”‘ The `window` object represents the browser's open window and has many properties, including methods.

* Open `25-Ins_Object-This/script.js` in your IDE:

  * The `this` keyword refers an object. The global object is the open browser window. You can see `this` at work in the following example:

    ```js
    console.log(this);
    ```

  * When we use `this` inside an object like `planet`, the keyword `this` belongs to that object and is used to refer to the object's properties, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    logFacts: function () {
      console.log("This planet's name is " + this.name);
      console.log("This planet's age is " + this.age);
    }
    ```

  * When we call an object's method, `this` refers to the object that the method belongs to. Because `logPopulation` belongs to the `planet` object in the following example, `this` refers to `planet`:

    ```js
    logPopulation: function () {
      if (this.isPopulated) {
        console.log("This planet's population is " + this.population);
      } else {
        console.log("The planet is unpopulated");
      }
    }
    ```


### 9. Student Do: this 

* `26_Stu_Object-This/README.md`.


### 10. BREAK

### 11. Instructor Review: this


* Open `26-Stu_Object_This/Solved/script.js` in your IDE:

  * ðŸ”‘ When we log the keyword `this` alone&mdash;like in the following example&mdash;the global object, or `window`, is logged:

    ```js
    console.log(this);
    ```

  * When we use `this` inside a function, `this` refers to the global object, as follows:

    ```js
    function helloThis() {
      console.log("Inside this function, this is " + this);
    }
    ```

  * ðŸ”‘ When we use `this` inside an object, `this` is local and belongs to that object, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    var child = {
      age: 10,
      ageTenYears: function() {
        console.log(this.age + 10);
      }
    };
    ```

  * ðŸ”‘ When we use `this` in a nested object, `this` refers to the object where it is used even if it is inside another object, like in the following example:

    ```js
    var investor = {
      name: "Cash Saver",
      investment: {
      initialInvestment: 5000,
      investmentGrowth: function() {
        console.log(this.initialInvestment * 1.15)
        }
      }
    };
    ```

  * ðŸ”‘ When we call an object's method, `this` still refers to the object the method belongs to&mdash;even when it is called outside the object, like in the following code:

    ```js
    child.ageTenYears();
    investor.investment.investmentGrowth();
    ```


### 12. Everyone Do: Git Branching and Merging

* Open the [Atlassian guide to using branches](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches) in your browser and explain the following:

  * When we work on new features or bug fixes, or when we work in a collaborative environment, it is not a good idea to work directly in the `main` branch.

  * Using Git, we can create a copy of the `main` branch and then work in a different branch. Doing so enables us to work in isolation, without messing up the codebase.

  * In this activity, we'll explore the `git branch`, `git checkout`, and `git merge` commands and how we can use them to work in different branches and merge branches locally.

   `27-Evr_Git-Branch/README.md`.


* Open your command line:

  * ðŸ”‘ We can create a new branch to work in, as shown in the following code, but it doesn't immediately take us to that new branch:

    ```bash
    git branch <name-of-branch>
    ```

  * ðŸ”‘ If we want to move into that branch to work, we use the `checkout` command, as follows:

    ```bash
    git checkout <name-of-branch>
    ```

  * ðŸ”‘ Alternatively, we can create a branch and `checkout` into it simultaneously, as follows:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b <name-of-branch>
    ```

  * ðŸ”‘ When we finish making changes in the branch, we commit the work to it and `checkout` back to the branch we want this new code to be merged to, then we merge it with the following command:

    ```bash
    git add -A
    git commit -m 'commit message'

    git checkout main
    git merge <name-of-branch>
    ```

  * When we're done, we can keep the feature branch or delete it, as follows:

    ```bash
    git branch -d <name-of-branch>
    ```


### 13. Instructor Demo: Mini-Project

* Open `28-Stu_Mini-Project/index.html` in your browser:



### 14. Student Do: Mini-Project (45 min)

* `28-Stu_Mini-Project/README.md`.


### 15. Instructor Review: Mini-Project 


* Open `28-Stu_Mini-Project/Main/script.js` in your IDE:

  * We declare variables that will be used to count the wins, losses, and ties, as follows:

    ```js
    var wins = 0;
    var ties = 0;
    var losses = 0;
    ```

  * We also create an array to hold all the possible choices the computer can make, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    var options = ["R", "P", "S"];
    ```

  * ðŸ”‘ To play the game, the user has to enter a choice. We use `window.prompt()` to grab the choice and store it in a variable, as follows:

    ```js
    var userChoice = window.prompt("Enter R, P, or S:");
    ```

  * To compare with the computer's pick, the `userChoice` must be capital letters. So we use a string method, shown in the following example, to ensure that all choices are uppercase:

    ```js
    userChoice = userChoice.toUpperCase();
    ```

  * ðŸ”‘ We use `Math.floor()` combined with `Math.Random()` to select a random index from the `options` array, as follows:

    ```js
    var index = Math.floor(Math.random() * options.length);
    ```

  * ðŸ”‘ The `index` is then used to assign the computer a choice, as follows:

    ```js
    var computerChoice = options[index];
    ```

  * ðŸ”‘ We use `window.alert()` to alert the user of the computer's pick in the browser, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    window.alert("The computer chose " + computerChoice);
    ```

  * ðŸ”‘ We use conditional statements to determine whether the game is a tie, win, or loss.

  * If the `userChoice` and `computerChoice` are equal, then it is a tie. We increment `tie` and alert the user that `"It's a tie!"`, as follows:

    ```js
    if (userChoice === computerChoice) {
      ties++;
      window.alert("It's a tie!");
    }
    ```

  * If it is not a tie, we check whether the user has won, with the following code:

    ```js
    else if (
      (userChoice === "R" && computerChoice === "S") ||
      (userChoice === "P" && computerChoice === "R") ||
      (userChoice === "S" && computerChoice === "P")
    ) {
      wins++;
      window.alert("You win!");
    }
    ```

  * If it is not a tie or a win, then we alert the user that it is a loss and increment `losses`, as follows:

    ```js
    else {
      losses++;
      window.alert("You lost!");
    }
    ```

  * We use an alert to show the user the stats. In the following example, `\n` creates line breaks:

    ```js
    window.alert(
      "Stats:\nWins: " + wins + "\nLosses: " + losses + "\nTies: " + ties
    );
    ```

  * We use `window.confirm()` to determine whether the user wants to play again, as follows:

    ```js
    var playAgain = window.confirm("Play again?");
    ```
