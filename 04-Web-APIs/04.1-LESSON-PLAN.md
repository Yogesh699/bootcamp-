## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: 

  * **Web APIs**: In this module, we will learn how to use JavaScript to manipulate HTML with the help of Web APIs. 

  * **What is the web browser?**: 

    * A **web browser**, or **browser**, is a program used to access information on the World Wide Web.

    * Every webpage, image, and video on the web can be accessed via a specific **Uniform Resource Locator (URL)**.

    * Browsers use the URL to retrieve resources from a web server and display them on a user's device.
  
  * **What is an API?**

    * An **API (Application Programming Interface)** is a set of methods, properties, events, and URLs that developers use to interact with components of a user's web browser.

    * APIs can also interact with data sets, hardware or software on a user’s computer, and third-party software and services.
    
  * **What is a Web API?**

    * **Web APIs** are built into the web browser and contain methods that allow us to manipulate a webpage using JavaScript.

    * We use Web APIs to create elements and add them to the browser or to add and remove styles and attributes&mdash;all via JavaScript.
    
  * **What is the DOM?**

    * When we open a webpage, the browser creates a tree of objects that represent the opened page. That tree of objects is the **DOM**, or **Document Object Model**.

    * Using the DOM, we can manipulate the HTML elements on the page via JavaScript. 
    
  * In this module, we will take the next step in building interactive webpages by learning how to harness the power of the DOM and Web APIs to access, create, and change HTML using JavaScript.
  
  * Let's take a quick look at the mini-project that we will do at the end of this module.

* Navigate to `28-Stu_Mini-Project/Main/index.html` in your browser:


### 2. Instructor Demo: Window Object

* Open `01-Ins_Window-Object/index.html` in your browser:

  * 🔑 The `window` object represents an open window in a browser. When we log `this`, the `window` object is returned.

  * 🔑 When we open the `window` object, we can see the properties and methods that belong to the window. 

  * 🔑 The document is a property of the `window` object. We log `window.document` to return the document interface.

  * 🔑 The document is the entry point for the webpage's content. We log `document.body` to access the `<body>` element. 


### 3. Student Do: Window Object

* `02-Stu_Window-Object\README.md`.


### 4. Instructor Review: Window Object

* Open `02-Stu_Window-Object/script.js` in your IDE: 

  * 🔑 We log `window` to return the `window` object (the browser window), as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    console.log(window);
    ```

  * 🔑 Because the `document` is a property of the `window` object, we log `window.document` to return a reference to the entire document&mdash;like in the following example:

    ```js
    console.log(window.document);
    ```

  * 🔑 Because `document` serves as the entry point to a webpage's content, we use `document.documentElement` to log the document's root element or the `<HTML>`&mdash;as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    console.log(document.documentElement);
    ```

  * 🔑 We use `document.head` to log the document's `<head>` element, as follows: 

    ```js
    console.log(document.head);
    ```


### 5. Instructor Demo: Traverse DOM

* Open `03-Ins_Traverse-DOM/index.html` in your browser and navigate to the console:

  * 🔑 Working your way down the DOM tree is called **DOM traversal**. First, we log `document.body` to access the `<body>` contained in the document.

  * 🔑 We can view all the elements nested inside the `<body>` by logging `document.body.children`.

  * 🔑 To access the first element in the body, we log `document.body.children[0]`.

  * 🔑 We use the terms **parent** and **child** to explain how elements in the DOM are related. A parent element is an element that holds one or more children. But child elements can also have children! To access an element nested in a child element, we log `document.body.children[1].children[0]`.

* Open `03-Ins_Traverse-DOM/index.html` in your IDE:

  * 🔑 DOM traversal allows us to access the DOM using parent-child relationships, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    console.log(document.body.children[1].children[0]);
    ```
  
  * 🔑 We can also access an element directly by targeting the id of the element using the method `getElementbyId()`, like in the following example:

    ```js
    var firstChildUl = document.getElementById("first-child-ul")
    console.log(firstChildUl);
    ```

  * 🔑 We can set and change a selected element's style by accessing an element's `style` object and its properties and assigning a value, like in the following example:

    ```js
    firstChildUl.style.color = "green";
    ```


### 6. Student Do: Traverse DOM

* `04-Stu_Traverse-DOM/Unsolved/README.md`.


### 7. Instructor Review: Traverse DOM


* Open `04-Stu_Traverse-DOM/Solved/script.js` in your IDE: 

  * 🔑 We use the method `getElementById()` to select the elements with an id of `header` and `articles`, and we store them in variables. See the following code for an example:

    ```js
    var articlesDiv = document.getElementById("articles");
    var headerDiv = document.getElementById("header");
    ```

  * 🔑 To access elements nested inside the `div` or `header` elements, we use `children[]`, which will return a list of all the child elements. To select the first child element of the article `<div>`, we use `children[0]`. This selects the article title and sets the font size. See the following code for an example:

    ```js
    articlesDiv.children[0].style.fontSize = "50px";
    ```

  * 🔑 The headline "Welcome to World News" is the first child of the `<header>` element. We access the element's `style` object to set the `color` of font to `white`, as follows: 

    ```js
    headerDiv.children[0].style.color = "white";
    ```

### 8. Instructor Demo: Setting Attributes

* Open `05-Ins_Setting-Attributes/index.html` in your browser:

  * All of the elements on this page have been styled in JavaScript using Web API methods.

  * 🔑 We select multiple elements to style using the document method `querySelectorAll()`.

  * 🔑 We style those elements using the element method `setAttribute()`.

  * We can also use `setAttribute()` to set an image's source directly.

* Open `05-Ins_Setting-Attributes/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE:

  * 🔑 We select all the `<p>` and `<div>` elements using the `querySelectorAll()` method and store the lists in variables, as follows:

    ```js
    var divTags = document.querySelectorAll("div");
    var pTags = document.querySelectorAll("p");
    ```
  
  * 🔑 We access the first element of a selector using `querySelector()`. This method returns a single element. See the following code for an example:

    ```js
    var changeP = document.querySelector("#change2");
    ```

  * 🔑 We use `setAttribute()` to set an image's source. The method takes two parameters. The first parameter names the attribute we want to change, and the second is the value we want to assign to the attribute, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    imgEl[0].setAttribute("src", "images/image_1.png");
    ```

  * 🔑 We can also use `setAttribute()` to set the style of the image, as follows:

    ```js
    imgEl[0].setAttribute("style", "width:500px; height:200px;");
    ```

  * 🔑 We iterate over a list of elements to apply the styling changes to all the elements in the list, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    for (var i = 0; i < divTags.length; i++) {
      divTags[i].setAttribute("style", "color:blue; font-size: 30px");
    }
    ```

### 9. Student Do: Setting Attributes

*  `06-Stu_Setting-Attributes/README.md`.


### 10. BREAK

### 11. Instructor Review: Setting Attributes


* Open `06-Stu_Setting-Attributes/Solved/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE: 

  * 🔑 We use `querySelectorAll()` to select all the `<h4>` elements in the document. We store the list in a variable, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    var siteTitles = document.querySelectorAll("h4");
    ```

  * 🔑  We use `setAttribute()` to set the styles for the elements. We can set multiple styles at the same time, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    siteTitles[i].setAttribute("style", "color: blue; font-weight: bolder; font-size: 30px; padding-left:10px; margin: 0");
    ```

  * 🔑 We use a loop to iterate over all the `<h4>` elements in the list and apply the styles, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    for (var i = 0; i < siteTitles.length; i++) {
      siteTitles[i].setAttribute("style", "color: blue; font-weight: bolder; font-size: 30px; padding-left:10px; margin: 0");
    }
    ```

### 12. Instructor Demo: Create Append

* Open `07-Ins_Create-Append/index.html` in your browser:

  * When we open the browser window, a prompt appears, asking the user to enter an HTML element. We can enter one or more elements, following the prompts. 

  * If valid elements are selected, a message indicates that a new element was created based on the user input.

  * 🔑 The element and the message it contains were all created dynamically using JavaScript.

* Open `07-Ins_Create-Append/script.js` in your IDE:

  * 🔑 We use the method `createElement()` to create new elements, as follows:

    ```js
    var tag = document.createElement(tagName);
    ```

  * We use the `textContent` property to add content to the element, as follows:

    ```js
    tag.textContent = "This was made via prompts. It's a " + tagName + ".";
    ```

  * When we create an element, it will not appear unless it is appended to another element in the HTML. We use `appendChild()` to attach the new element as a child of the `<body>`, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    document.body.appendChild(tag);
    ```


### 13. Student Do: Create Append

* `08-Stu_Create-Append/README.md`.


### 14. Instructor Review: Create Append


* Open `08-Stu_Create-Append/Solved/script.js` in your IDE: 

  * 🔑 We create the ordered list element using `createElement()`, as follows:

    ```js
    var listEl = document.createElement("ol");
    ```

  * The ordered list has four child list elements. We use `createElement()` to create each list item and store the elements in a variable, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    var li1 = document.createElement("li");
    var li2 = document.createElement("li");
    var li3 = document.createElement("li");
    var li4 = document.createElement("li");
    ```

  * 🔑 We add text to the list elements using the `textContent` property, like in the following example:

    ```js
    li1.textContent = "Apples 🍎 ";
    li2.textContent = "Pizza 🍕 ";
    li3.textContent = "Dumplings 🥟 ";
    li4.textContent = "Cupcakes 🧁 ";
    ```

  * 🔑 We append the ordered list element as a child of the `<div>` that contains the text "My favorite foods are:" using `appendChild()`, as follows:

    ```js
    favoriteEl.appendChild(listEl);
    ```

  * 🔑 We then append the list items as a child of the ordered list element. This attaches the elements to the HTML document, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    listEl.appendChild(li1);
    listEl.appendChild(li2);
    listEl.appendChild(li3);
    listEl.appendChild(li4);
    ```

  * We add styling to the ordered list element and child list items using `setAttribute()`, like in the following example:

    ```js
    listEl.setAttribute("style", "background:#333333; padding:20px;");
    li1.setAttribute("style", " color:white; background: #666666; padding: 5px; margin-left: 35px;");
    li2.setAttribute("style", " color:white; background: #777777; padding: 5px; margin-left: 35px;");
    li3.setAttribute("style", " color:white; background: #888888; padding: 5px; margin-left: 35px;");
    li4.setAttribute("style", " color:white; background: #999999; padding: 5px; margin-left: 35px;");
    ```

### 15. Instructor Demo: Timers and Intervals

* Open `09-Ins_Timers-Intervals/index.html` in your browser:

  * 🔑 We can use JavaScript to create a countdown timer. 

  * 🔑 The timer will evaluate an expression at a set interval until it is cleared&mdash;in this case, once every second. 
  
  * 🔑 We can use JavaScript to create and append an image that appears only after the timer is cleared.

* Open `09-Ins_Timers-Intervals/script.js` in your IDE:

  * 🔑 We store the interval in a variable. This is an important step, so that we can get the interval to stop. See the following code for an example:

    ```js
    var timerInterval = setInterval(function() {...}, 1000)
    ```

  * 🔑 The `setInterval()` method takes a function as its first argument, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    setInterval(function() {
      secondsLeft--;
      timeEl.textContent = secondsLeft + " seconds left till colorsplosion.";

      if(secondsLeft === 0) {
        clearInterval(timerInterval);
        sendMessage();
      }

    }, 1000);
    ```

  * 🔑 The second argument that the `setInterval()` method takes is the interval. Because intervals use milliseconds, we use `1000` to create an interval of one second, as follows:

    ```js
    }, 1000);
    ```

  * 🔑 The function is the action that we want to be evaluated at each interval. This function prints a message at each interval, as follows:

    ```js
    function() {
      secondsLeft--;
      timeEl.textContent = secondsLeft + " seconds left till colorsplosion.";

      if(secondsLeft === 0) {
        clearInterval(timerInterval);
        sendMessage();
      }
    ```

  * 🔑 When the countdown reaches zero, we want the action to stop. The `clearInterval()` method stops the execution of the interval. It takes one parameter: the variable name assigned to the interval. See the following code for an example:

    ```js
    clearInterval(timerInterval);
    ```

  * 🔑 We call `sendMessage()` after the interval is cleared, so the image will pop up after the countdown is complete. The `sendMessage` function creates and appends the image to the document, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    function sendMessage() {
      timeEl.textContent = " ";

      var imgEl = document.createElement("img");

      imgEl.setAttribute("src", "images/image_1.jpg");
      mainEl.appendChild(imgEl);

    }
    ```


### 16. Student Do: Timers and Intervals

*  `10-Stu_Timers-Intervals/README.md`.


### 17. Instructor Review: Timers and Intervals


* Open `10-Stu_Timers-Intervals/Solved/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * We first use `getElementById()` to select the HTML elements with "countdown" and "main" IDs.

    ```js
    var timerEl = document.getElementById('countdown');
    var mainEl = document.getElementById('main');
    ```

  * We then declare a `message` variable with a string of text. We then use the `.split()` method to _split_ the string into individual elements in an array, `words`. 

    ```js
    var message =
      'Some say the world will end in 🔥, Some say in ice. From what I’ve tasted of desire, I hold with those who favor fire. But if it had to perish twice, I think I know enough of hate. To say that for destruction ice, Is also great, And would suffice.';
    var words = message.split(' ');
    ```

  * We declare a `countdown()` function. Within our `countdown()` function, we declare a `timeLeft` variable and set it to 5.

    ```js
    function countdown() {
      var timeLeft = 5;
    ```

  * 🔑 We then declare `timeInterval` and assign it the value of `setInterval()`. Here, we will update the text in `timerEl` at an interval of 1000 ms, or 1 second. With each interval, we _decrement_ the value of `timeLeft`. If `timeLeft` is equal to 0, we use `clearInterval()` to stop `timeInterval()`. 

  ```js
  var timeInterval = setInterval(function() {
    if (timeLeft > 1) {
      timerEl.textContent = timeLeft + ' seconds remaining';
      timeLeft--;
    } else if (timeLeft === 1) {
      timerEl.textContent = timeLeft + ' second remaining';
      timeLeft--;
    } else {
      timerEl.textContent = '';
      clearInterval(timeInterval);
      displayMessage();
    }
  }, 1000);
  ```

  * To briefly explain the `displayMessage()` function, we declare a variable called `wordCount` and set it to `0`

    ```js
    function displayMessage() {
      var wordCount = 0;
    ```

  * We then declare a `msgInterval` variable and, as above, assign it the value of `setInterval()`. Within our callback, we check if our `words` array contains anything. If not, we clear the interval. 

    ```js
    var msgInterval = setInterval(function () {
      if (words[wordCount] === undefined) {
        clearInterval(msgInterval);
      } 
    ```
  
  * Otherwise, we update the `textContent` of `mainEl` with the string at `words[wordCount]`. With each interval, we increment `wordCount`. Each interval is set to the length of 1000 milliseconds. 

    ```js
        else {
          mainEl.textContent = words[wordCount];
          wordCount++;
        }
      }, 1000);
    }
    ```
